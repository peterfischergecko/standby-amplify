# Standby-Amplify
## Description
The goal of this project is to learn about features and limitations of the AWS Amplify framework. Project Standby is a series of small web applications with near identical functionality but different underlying AWS technologies. The application provides an overview of planned on-call times of team members and allows the team leader to assign additional times.

## Technology
The project consists mainly of an Angular Material single page application and a GraphQL API specification. The backend is largely generated by the AWS Amplify framework.
